Each thought he was thinking of nothing but "Snark"
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl
Then, silence.
Some fancied they heard in the air
There was silence supreme!
Not a shriek, not a scream,
When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,
But the crew would do nothing but groan.
